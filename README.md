# fresa :strawberry:

A tiny game engine made in `c++20`.

_This is a reimplementation of **fresa** from scratch. The motivation behind it is to focus on clarity and documentation from the beginning. You can see the source for the fully-functioning legacy version [here](https://github.com/josekoalas/fresa-legacy)._ 

A template project is available in [aguacate](https://github.com/josekoalas/aguacate). Tested in **clang 14.0.6**, **gcc 12.1.0** and **apple clang 14.0.0**.
